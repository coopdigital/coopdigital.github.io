We have a community of digital technologists across digital and the wider Co-op. We come together regularly to share knowledge and learn from each other. The domains for our products vary from funeralcare to healthcare to food and insurance. With everything in between.</p>

    	<li>a commitment to putting users at the heart of the development process</li>
    </ul>
