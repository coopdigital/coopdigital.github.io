title: HAC100 Youth Hack Challenge
---
Co-op Digital are delighted to be a sponsor of [Hack Manchester's all-female youth hack!] (https://www.hac100.com/event/FYHInspiringStories2019) The hackathon is a two-day coding competition for young coders aged 11-18. As well as sponsoring, we've laid down a challenge for the hackers!
### The challenge is... *make something to connect people in your local community.*
 Thanks to Co-op members, together we’ve helped raise an amazing £19 million for local causes since November 2017..We give 1% of what members spend on Co-op branded food products in our stores and selected services,  to local projects – from improving community spaces or helping school leavers learn life skills, to simply connecting people. So, we'd like to see the teams come up with ways to connect people in their local community: 

- This could be:
	- a web page sharing information about life in your community
	- using google maps, a way of showing interesting places in your community on a map
	- using a dataset or API to find and display interesting information about your community 
	- a way of creating a group of local people to share food or activities with


- Interesting datasets can be found on [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
