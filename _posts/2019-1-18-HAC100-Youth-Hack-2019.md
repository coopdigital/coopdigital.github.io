title: HAC100 Youth Hack Challenge
---

## Thanks to Co-op members, together we’ve helped raise an amazing £19 million for local causes since November 2017.

We give 1% of what members spend on Co-op branded food products in our stores and selected services, as well as money raised from sales of carrier bags and Co-op scratch cards in our stores, to local projects – from improving community spaces or helping school leavers learn life skills, to simply connecting people.

### The challenge is... *make something to connect people in your local community.*

- This could be:
	- a web page sharing information about life in your community
	- using google maps, a way of showing interesting places in your community on a map
	- using a dataset or API to find and display interesting information about your community 
	- a way of creating a group of local people to share food or activities with


- Interesting datasets can be found on [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
